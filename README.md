## 👇 Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js: ReactJS requires Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, to run on your machine. 
You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is installed automatically along with Node.js. It is used to install and manage dependencies for your ReactJS projects.

Once you have Node.js installed, open your command prompt or terminal and verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running the following commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```
